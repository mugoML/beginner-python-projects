# Beginner Python Projects

Welcome to my Python learning portfolio.  
This repository contains a collection of simple Python projects I've built while learning the basics of programming and problem-solving.

Each script focuses on core Python skills like input/output, conditionals, loops, and basic functions.

## Projects Included

1. Simple Calculator  
   A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Shopping List  
   A command-line shopping list manager that lets users add and view items.

3. Area and Perimeter Calculator  
   Calculates the area and perimeter of rectangles or squares from user input.

4. Madlib Game  
   A fun text-based game that creates a story using words provided by the user.

## How to Run These

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a .py file in your code editor.
3. Run it using:
python filename.py

## What's Next

I’ll continue to add more beginner projects as I grow — including file handling, loops, and eventually, data science tools like pandas and matplotlib.
